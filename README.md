# DTMF Decoder
This was the final project for my DSP class, where a matlab scripts needed to be written to decode
Dual Tone Multi-frequency signals. Two different methods for decoding were explored: filter banks, and modulation. 
There is more information about how it works in the report (pdf). The program is set up to input a mp3 file with the signal. Sample files are
contained in the `wavfiles/` directory.
